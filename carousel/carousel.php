               <p>Peace is more than 
                  the absence of war, 
                  it is living together 
                  with our differences – 
                  of sex, race, language, 
                  religion or culture – while 
                  furthering universal respect 
                  for justice and human rights 
                  on which such coexistence depends

               <p>Peace comes from being able to contribute the best that we have, 
                  and all that we are, toward creating a world that supports everyone. 
                  But it is also securing the space for others to contribute the best 
                  that they have and all that they are.</p>
